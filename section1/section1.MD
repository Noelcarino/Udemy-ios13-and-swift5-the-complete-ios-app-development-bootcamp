### How to Make the Most of the Bootcamp
  - Code on Main Computer
  - Watch lectures on separate device
  - Take notes
  - Make sure to do tutorials in sequence
  - Do coding challenges

### How to Get Help when you're stuck
  - What do you expect vs reality?
  - google error code (it is part of the development flow)
  - 4 step approach (For Q & A)
  - 1. What did you Expect
  - 2. What actually happened
